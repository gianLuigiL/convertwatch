                <p>ConvertWatch has come to life because I'm a european national and crossing in and out the UK 
                    with the ever-changing pound's value to look out for is a job on its own. <span role="img" aria-label="sad face">ðŸ˜±</span> So here comes ConvertWatch, a free, no-frills currency watchdog, all at screaming speed.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="paragraph_highlight">
                <h2><span class="highlight_title">Is</span> <span class="highlight_title">it</span> <span class="highlight_title">free?</span></h2>
                <p>ConvertWatch is free. I made ConvertWatch for myself and decided that it might be useful for everyone who crosses the border regularly. 
                    One day karma will pay me back.</p>

                <p>The whole thing takes 10 seconds, you select the initial currency. The target currency, and the percentage you hope to make.</p>
                <p>Example: You are a british lad looking to go on holiday in Spain this august. You select the &pound; as your initial currency, the &euro; as target currency and the percentage you wish to reach</p>
                <p>If your target percentage is met you will receive an email, if your percentage is not met in the arc of 6 months the entry will be automatically deleted.</p>

                <p>Only your email is stored and it's deleted the exact same moment you receive your confirmation, 
                    either you reached your goal or the entry has exceeded 6 months</p>

                <p>Rates are everchanging, by the time you perform your exchange it might have shifted.</p>
                <p>ConvertWatch will send you an email based on the exact rate as it's provided, but the currency exchange body of your choice 
                    might apply different rates and fees</p>
                <p>I usually use TransferWise as I find it to be the closest to the official value, but you do you.</p>
